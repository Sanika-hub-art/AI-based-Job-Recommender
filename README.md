# AI-based-Job-Recommender
Developed an ML-based Job Recommender System to enhance job matching for seekers and recruiters by leveraging content-based filtering. Utilized Selenium for web scraping data from LinkedIn and Indeed, capturing job postings and applicant profiles. Conducted data preprocessing using NLP techniques, implemented TF-IDF for feature extraction, and used cosine similarity to match job seekers' skills with job requirements and recommend suitable candidates to recruiters and vice versa.
